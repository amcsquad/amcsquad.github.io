## FAQ

### Do I need to pay an entrance fee if I’m just buying things?

No! There is no entrance fee — buyers can show up on the day and enter for free.

### My baby’s nap time is around the start of the event. Will people be coming later?

Yes! Parents — including buyers and sellers — are showing up later after naps. The whole time there will be items to browse, hot beverages to buy, and a play area to enjoy!

### Can I sell items for more than €2?

The spirit of the sale is to sell everything for €2 or less, to swap good quality items with community parents without breaking the bank.

You can sell a maximum of 5 items at a time over €2, and none priced over €10. 

### Who is organizing this? How are you paying for all of this?

This is a labor of love from the Amsterdam Mama Walks group admins, Geraldine and Alex (from the Amsterdam Parent Project) 💗 The Amsterdam Parent Project is covering the cost of the space and other materials.

Our goal is to reach the many parents in West that don’t have places in the neighborhood to gather together and contribute to the circular economy of baby items. 

### Can I help on the day? In the future?

If you want to help us set up or tear down, share the event with other groups, or organize future events — get in touch with Alex or Geraldine on WhatsApp! You can find our contact info in the Walks group.
