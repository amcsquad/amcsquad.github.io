# AMC Squad March 2025 News

As usual it's been almost a year since the last news post; busy at work on AMC Squad Episode Five. We're aiming for the tail end of 2025 but of course the sooner the better.

# AMC Squad Usermaps

First off, if you haven't checked them out already there's 3 great usermaps available in the mods tab above. Maps by Solais, Jolteon, and long-time Duke community legend William Gee (developer of WGRealms1) absolutely give them a try!
Gameplay adjustments

Among the usual wide array of new content, polishing and updates, there's been a few gameplay tweaks. All rapid fire weapons now have an initial grace period before their accuracy starts to bloom; this maintains the intention of taking careful shots at range whilst still allowing rapid fire weapons to not immediately lose effectiveness after a few shots. There's also been updates to melee attacks; the sweeping kick, triggered by jump+kick, is now much quicker and can actually stun enemies for a small duration, allowing you to get a spin kick in (backwards+kick) much quicker as well.
