#### **Where it started**
After my second son was born, almost 10 years ago, I was overweight and unhealthy. So I started running as a way to lose some weight and still be around to see my kids grow up. I did a 'Couch to 5k' type of program and ran some local 5k's. I eventually wanted to try going longer so one of my brothers talked me into running a half marathon. We signed up for the <a href="https://www.scottishhalfmarathon.com/" title="Scottish Half Marathon">Scottish Half Marathon</a>, and due to one reason or another my brother was unable to run. I finished and enjoyed myself. It was that race where I felt like I was having fun doing this and it wasn't just for fitness anymore. I started running more and ran 5k's up to half marathons.

#### **Where it started to take off**
Once I moved to Massachusetts with my family in 2015, I continued running. I stuck to the half marathon distance and below until the company that I worked for had a raffle for employees to get a <a href="https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon" title="Boston Marathon">Boston Marathon</a> entry. In the winter of 2017 my name was drawn and I started training for the race in April 2018. Race day came and the weather was <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/4/16/17242356/boston-marathon-weather-video-rain-wind" title="Boston Marathon 2018 weather">horrible</a>. I missed my goal time by 36 seconds. Determined to beat my goal time I ran the <a href="https://www.wineglassmarathon.com/" title="Wineglass Marathon">Wineglass Marathon</a> 15 minutes and 51 seconds faster than I ran the Boston Marathon just six months prior.

#### **Like a rocket, it took off**
Looking back at it, the day I ran the Boston Marathon was the day I realized that I really enjoy the challenge of running that far. The weather was horrible and that just brought more of a challenge so the question I kept asking myself was, "How do I continue to challenge myself?" The answer I came up with was to run an ultra distance. I chose a low key race in Vermont (there were less than 30 people signed up), the <a href="https://www.runthewitch.com/" title="NOR'WITCH 50k">NOR'WITCH 50k</a>. I ran that in October 2019, where there was cold weather with wind and rain the whole race. I ended up finishing in just under 6 hours, 5:56:44.

#### **The year (or so) that was (and maybe still is) C*VID**
2020 started off just like any other year; I had already signed up for a few races, the big one being <a href="https://www.marinemarathon.com/events/marathon/mcm-weekend/mcm50k" title="Marine Corps Marathon 50k">Marine Corps Marathon 50k</a> in the fall. Then Covid shut everything down and races were postponed or cancelled. Since I was working from home, I decided I would continue training in case races were held later that year. The end of the year was upon me before I knew it and I had run over 2,600 miles. More than double any previous year.

Races were still being postponed and cancelled when 2021 started and I still continued to run close to 70 miles each week. A friend had mentioned that the <a href="https://vermont50.com/" title="Vermont 50">Vermont 50</a> race was happening in late September. He did a fine job twisting my rubber arm and I signed up in early June. Well, that race was a month ago and I finished feeling like Superman! I plan on doing a race recap shortly, so be on the lookout for that.

My favorite running quote is by Dean Karnazes, "Run when you can, walk if you have to, crawl if you must; just never give up." I have repeated that mantra in my head for a few races now and it reminds me to keep going, no matter what. The pain will end, just never give up!

Until next time - Matt
