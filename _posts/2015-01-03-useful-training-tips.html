Having recently undertook the running of some training, I thought it would be beneficial to post some of the things I learnt from it. The training I was performing &nbsp;had around 8 trainees and latest 4 days and was for a system that is used in the Financial services industry.&nbsp;<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b><u>Be Active</u></b></div>
<div>
By 'Be Active' I mean 'work' the training room. Go round the room and see how people &nbsp;are getting on. Do they have a confused look on their faces? If so ask them if there is anything they do not understand or is there something they would like clarifying. Don't be a trainer that sits at his machine and just waits for the questions - be <b><i>proactive</i></b>!!!</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b><u>Make sure the exercises are completed</u></b></div>
<div>
If you training incorporates exercises that the trainees need to complete then encourage them to complete them. You're not doing your job as a trainer If they don't do the exercises and you then get bombarded with questions once they start using the system for real. Yes not all exercises will be valid real world scenarios but making sure they have used the system and understand the concepts will help.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b><u>Interact with the quiet ones</u></b></div>
<div>
Some trainees may sit at the back of the room and not get involved in any discussions. Sometimes you can forget they are there. If there are people like this then <i><b>engage</b></i> with them. Make an effort to see how they are getting on or ask them their opinion. They may be shy but some gentle coaxing and encouragement should help to get them more involved and they may have lots to contribute once they have some confidence.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b><u>Tailor the training for individuals</u></b></div>
<div>
Before the training try to get a list of the attendees and their various experiences. This way you can identify which trainees may need a little more help than others. If you find out there's roles and responsibilities you can then highlight how there role may change now that they are using the software or what aspects of the system they will mostly be interacting with.</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b><u>Be Passionate</u></b></div>
<div>
I'm sure I'm not the only one who has gone to a training course and has had a trainer who isnt very euthuseastic and passionate. Be passionate about the training and the product you are doing the training for. This enthusiasm could rub off of the trainees and if you they go back to their day jobs and love the product then great!! Think of it as a sales session - convince these people that this piece of software will benefit them in their daily tasks (If the software doesn't then I would look for another job......)</div>
<div>
<br></div>
<div>
<b><u>Get your material reviewed and printed</u></b></div>
<div>
If you are running a training session you want to make sure you and the training itself comes across as professional. One way to help do this is to make sure that there are not mistakes in the training material that you are providing. Get colleges to review your material and If someone has time get them to run through any exercises you have prepared. The other way is to get your training material printed professionally. Now this is not particularly expensive and professionally printed, bound training material will give the training a little special something.</div><div><br></div><div>Hope you have found these points useful and please feel free to comment on any things you have learnt whilst you were running or attending some training.</div>
