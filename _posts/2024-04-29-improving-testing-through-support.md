There are many ways in which you can improve a teams testing. One way is the learnings discovered through sprint retrospectives whilst another is for testers to go on courses or learn from testing communities. Both of these are excellent mechanisms for helping a team to improve their testing. But how about being able to improve testing through talking to the support team? It may feel that 
support are in their own little world, dealing with customers queries as well as fixing any issues that are raised. However, taking a step back, the support team are the one team that probably have 
more interaction with the end users that most other people. As well as that interaction they may have a massive wealth of information about how the users use the system through any bugs that have been raised. 

So how can the support team help us improve testing?

## Share how users use the system

In bugs that are raised there will probably be steps to reproduce. Now these steps will be written from the users perspective and this will provide insight into how they are using the system. It may give information such as:

* How they navigate through the system
* Do they use keyboard shortcuts
* Examples of real life data that they enter
* The order in which they perform certain tasks

Now this information is very useful from a testing perspective. When testing testers will typically do things a certain way. For example a tester may use the mouse to copy and paste data into the system. But what if through looking at support tickets  a lot of users use keyboard shortcuts? Yes you are testing the copy and paste functionality but you are not using the system like users seem to be. So there is potentially a gap where the testing being done os not representative of how a user uses the system. Now you are never going to test exactly like a user uses the system but if you can cover some of 
what they do it will help to make sure that the users are satisfied when they use the system.

So how can this be documented? Well it may just be something simple like Sharepoint site that the support team create that documents some key behaviours about the users. The development teams can then use this to help guide how they test. Now the information may change as time goes on but it will be a useful resource for anyone who tests the system. 

## Learn testing (and quality) Lessons

Bugs will always get through. You are not going to be able to stop but they will always get through. Your users may never find the bugs but they will always exist. When a bug is found the best outcome is that it is fixed and deployed as quickly as possible and lessons are learnt. A great way to learn lessons is to look at support tickets that have been raised and understand how various elements (including testing) could have been done better to stop the issue happening again.

Now when issues get issues raised and each issue will involve interaction with the users around things such as:
	* What is the error
	* What steps were performed prior to the error occurring
	* What data was used
	* How it impacts the user

Now the support team will have hopefully understood the issue and managed to fix it. By doing this they have in depth knowledge of the issue. Now combining this with the input if a testing 
professional they can try and understand why the issue happened and what could have been done to prevent it. Now in my experience issues raised to the support team will typically cover the following kinds of things:

* System questions
* Technical questions
* Software faults
* Behaviour Questions

Now each of these provides an opportunity to not only improve testing but also the quality of other aspects of the system (By system I mean the actual software and supporting artifacts)

First lets look at the questions....

### System Questions


### Technical Questions


### Behaviour Question






So how can we learn from support

DIAGRAM ABOUT THE PROCESS


Set-up meeting with support

Speak to support about buy in

How can you go about getting the ball rolling…..?

Get buy in
Speak to the support manager to explain what you want to do and why you want to do it. The main benefit of better
Testing will be less support tickets. This in turn will free up team for their team to work on other things.  This also will give the customer a better XXXXX of the product as they are raising less support tickets than they have in the past. And remember only the customer can define XX what quality looks like so it goes a long way to helping with that.

Set up a meeting with the support team 
Once you have buy in set up a meeting at a convenient interval. I have found that monthly intervals is good for this. It is long enough that you will have something to talk about and short enough that the last meeting is relatively fresh in people heads. 

What to do in that meeting
The support team walk through each ticket that was closed in the last month and explain:
	○ What the issue was
	○ Why the client uses this feature (May be obvious)
	○ How the issue was effecting the customer
	○ How it was fixed
	○ Any issues around fixing it

Discussion
Once the support team have given an overview of the issue the people in the meeting discuss what lessons can be learnt. Now these lessons could be any of the following:
	○ Testing Lesson
		○ Could this issue have been caught with another type of testing? Ws the sceanrio missed? This is all about improvements in testing that could be made that would catch the issue.
	○ Documentation improvement Lesson
		○ Could documentation be improved to stop a support ticket being raised. For example if there was a user manual and a user raised a support ticket about how to do something then this could  feed into an improvement in the product documentation. 
	○ Requirements Lesson
		○ Is the issue purely one where what was built did not match what the users want? This could be  requirements issue that means the requirements process needs to be improved in order to make sure similar things do not happen again. 
	○ Process Lesson

Once the lessons have been discovered these should be documented in a central place where everyone can see them and use them. 

How can teams learn from the lessons?

Now that the lessons have been documented team can go to them and look to see of there are any lessons that they can use to help tem with their work. It may be athat a new team works on a simialr feature to one that had a support ticket raised and lessons where learnt. 


Why do this?
