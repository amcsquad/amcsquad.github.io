I passed the Microsoft AZ-400: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions exam in the first attempt with the score of 830 (The passing score is 700) right before the end of 2022. I would like to share the following exam preparation tips:

- Complete all the self-paced AZ-400 learning paths on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-400?tab=tab-learning-paths). Make sure to answer all the questions in the Knowledge check section of each module.
- Finish the Udemy course [AZ-400 Designing and Implementing DevOps Certification 2022](https://cba.udemy.com/course/azure100/) including the practice tests offered by Alan Rodrigues

If your company has an Enterprise Skills Initiative agreement with Microsoft, you can access them via [Microsft Certification](https://esi.microsoft.com/getcertification) page.
