<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">How aware are you? Do you live in the here and now or is your mind
always somewhere else?<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><br />
This blog post is about Mindfulness. Mindfulness is a simple meditation and is
defined as (According to Wikipedia):<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><br />
<b>"The intentional, accepting and non-judgemental focus of one's
attention on the emotions, thoughts and sensations occurring in the present
moment"</b><o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<b><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><br />
</span></b><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Now Mindfulness has become more popular in the west in recent years as
it has shown to have benefits for people who are suffering from Depression and
Anxiety. It has been around for a while and is often&nbsp;thought to of
originated from Buddhism and some people&nbsp;believe&nbsp;it
started&nbsp;thousands&nbsp;of years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Now modern life is hectic and I’m sure we all have lots of things going
on in our lives that keep our Brains busy and trying to focus on one thing at a
time can be a challenge. I can't&nbsp;remember&nbsp;the number of times I've
been doing something and my&nbsp;mind is somewhere else&nbsp;entirely. Mindfulness&nbsp;helps
you focus on what you are doing right now and being in that&nbsp;moment 100%.
Now imagine you are 30 years old and I tell you that you only have about 6
years of your life left. You would be shocked&nbsp;wouldn't&nbsp;you? <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Well......<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">If your 30 and have a life expectancy of 80 you have 50 years left (I
know, I'm a maths genius) However if you&nbsp;are&nbsp;only aware for 3 out of
16 hours a day you are awake, then you only have around 6 years and 3 months
left of your life. And let’s be honest If you are not in the here and now you
are not really living as life is probably passing you by.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><br />
So only being aware of what you are doing for 6 ish years out of 50
means&nbsp;you&nbsp;will not be totally focussed and aware of all of the great
things you are experiencing. &nbsp;You&nbsp;may say - hold on a minute I'm
aware for much more than 2 hours a day. Yes you are probably right, but spend a
day trying to note down all of the times you are 'in the moment' and add them
up at the end of the day. Are you really aware when you think you are? Are
you&nbsp;totally&nbsp;aware of the here and now when you drive home&nbsp;from
work? Or are you thinking about the weekend,&nbsp;what to have for tea or how
the kids got on at school today?<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Luckily Mindfulness is something that you can practice and there are
plenty of books and websites dedicated to how you can. An excellent
book&nbsp;on mindfulness is&nbsp;Mindfulness<i>: Finding Peace in a Frantic
World by Mark Williams.&nbsp;</i>It explains mindfulness and also has a CD
which is an 8 week course to help you become more mindful.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">This book starts you off by getting you to either sit or lay down and
focus on your breath. If you find you&nbsp;attention&nbsp;moving from your
breath to something else e.g. what you want&nbsp;for tea or what you need to do
at work, just accept the thought and move your focus back to the breath.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

How Mindfulness can help your testing</b></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><br />
Now how can Mindfulness help with testing? I think as a tester, where being
aware of how a system behaves and what steps we have just performed is
essential, then being 'Mindful' is a skill that we can't afford to be without.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><br />
Here are a few ways that Mindfulness can help your testing:<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><br />
1) Make you more aware of what steps you have just undertaken.<br />
Imagine it’s a Friday afternoon and you are&nbsp;testing&nbsp;away
and&nbsp;dreaming about what exciting plans you have&nbsp;for the weekend. All
of a sudden you notice an issue. You then try and remember the exact steps you
performed that created this issue. You rattle your Brain and you’re not quite
sure what you did. You then need to go through the entire test again and hope
you replicate the steps you had previously. By being Mindful you would be in
the 'here and now' and you would be focused on exactly what you were doing.
Therefore you could raise an issue with the developer straight away and not
have to try and replicate the steps again in the hope of getting them right.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">2) Helps you step out of Automatic pilot<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Have you ever had those drives to work that you&nbsp;don't&nbsp;really
remember? Have you ever finished your&nbsp;journey and thought - Was that traffic
light I went through green? If you have then you have been on auto pilot. By
being on auto pilot you don't see things that you would if you were focussed on
what you were doing. Imagine as part of a test you have to fill out a contact
form and the functionality&nbsp;of&nbsp;this form has not&nbsp;changed for
months. Now you may have done this 100 times before so you just jump straight
into it and start entering the information you always do. Now what if something
had changed in the page title? Like the colour of the traffic light on the way
to work, you may have missed it because you are on auto
pilot.&nbsp;Remember&nbsp;a key skill for a tester is about noticing changes
in&nbsp;behaviour and we need to be tuned in to what we are doing in order to
help us notice these changes.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">3) Find more issues<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">The more aware you are the more likely you are going to notice things
you may have normally missed. It could be something as simple as
a&nbsp;misaligned&nbsp;text box or something more fundamental like how a system
integrates&nbsp;with another system. We all miss issues but by being constantly
aware you are more likely to notice issues that you may have missed
previously.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">4) Take more away from conversations<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Have you ever been&nbsp;chatting&nbsp;to someone and your mind just
wonders to something totally different?&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all of a
sudden&nbsp;they say - "Got that?" And you not wanting
to&nbsp;sound&nbsp;rude say "Yep" then you sit back at your desk and
then&nbsp;rattle your brain thinking exactly what they were talking about. If
you are Mindful then you are less likely to have your mind wonder and
will&nbsp;know&nbsp;exactly they wanted you to get.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">5) Works well with&nbsp;exploratory&nbsp;testing<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">As you explore an application by learning about it through exploration
and experimentation, being aware of what you are doing and how the application
is behaving is essential. Being Mindful of what you uncover as you explore the
application as well as how you interacted with the system could prove valuable
when reporting your findings to end users and other members of your team. It
also may help you question why the application does things in particular ways.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><b>How you can practice Mindfulness</b></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><br />
</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">If you want to&nbsp;practice&nbsp;mindfulness&nbsp;I would highly
recommend the book mentioned earlier in this blog post.&nbsp;However if you
want to start straight away when don't you try the&nbsp;following:<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">1. Sit in a straight back chair with your hands on your lap and your
feet flat on the floor. You need to be relaxed but your posture needs to give
you a sense of being awake and aware<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">2. Start&nbsp;breathing&nbsp;through your nose<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">3. As you are breathing be aware of your chest moving up and down<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">4.&nbsp;Focus&nbsp;on this movement and nothing else<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">5. If you feel your thoughts moving away from this onto something else,
gently move your attention back to the&nbsp;movement&nbsp;of your chest.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">6. Try this for 5 minutes. It&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;matter how many times
your thoughts wonder the important thing is to move&nbsp;your attention gently
back to the&nbsp;movement&nbsp;of your chest.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Another thing I would recommend would be to pick 1 activity and really
focus on it. So for example cleaning your teeth. As you clean your teeth in the
morning and evening really&nbsp;focus&nbsp;on it......<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 13.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;">How does
     the&nbsp;brush&nbsp;feel against my teeth<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 13.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;">The flavour of the tooth
     paste<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: 13.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;">How the toothpaste feels in
     your mouth the first time it touches your teeth.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">It seem like an odd thing to do but you may find that something like
cleaning your teeth is an enjoyable experience once you are aware of it, rather
than being just something that you do before you go to work and bed.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Mindfulness is a skill and requires practice so don't expect to do a
couple of practices and all of a sudden be aware of everything. Like all things
you get out what you put in.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">
