I am a creature of habit. I like to have my breakfast at work and go to the Gym on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.&nbsp;<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
In fact we are all creatures of Habit, even though you may not think you are. A university researcher in 2006 found that more than 40% of the actions people perform each day were not actual decisions but habit!!</div>
<div>
<br /></div>

In my upcoming blog posts I will be looking at human habits and how they relate to testing - I may not discover much but I have a habit of wanting to try :). I will break the posts down into the following:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
1) The habit loop</div>
<div>
2) Problems with habits</div>
<div>
3) Good habits</div>
<div>
4) Changing habits</div>
<div>
<br /></div>

I hope you enjoy the posts and please feel free to comment when they are published.</div>
