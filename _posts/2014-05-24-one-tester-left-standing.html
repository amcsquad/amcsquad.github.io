<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Now you may have found yourself in the same situation as me, the
only tester working on a particular project with the usual aggressive project
timelines. Although this may seem daunting at first there are a few things I
have found that can help.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">NOTE: In this post I try and called what
testers would traditionally call defects, problems. I have done this after
reading this:<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><u>Keep Test cases simple</u></b><o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Being the sole tester on a project you
often do not have the luxury to spend a long time planning your testing. If
this is the case keep you need to keep test planning simple but with enough
detail so you know exactly what you want to test. A great tool for this is mind
maps, which allow you to capture key tests in a quick and easy way without having
to go into lots of detail. How you structure you mind map is up to you so long
as <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 36.0pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -18.0pt;">
<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->It can be read and understood by another
person<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 36.0pt; margin-right: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -18.0pt;">
<!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->If you have to go back to it, it is clear
what the testing was<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0cm;">
<br /></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If you don’t use exploratory testing, Mind Maps can help you
document all your tests without the odious task of having to create an Excel
monster document than details each test. If you do use exploratory testing then
mind maps can quickly help plan what areas needs testing and as you
explore the system and find new tests these can be added with a few mouse clicks.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<b><u><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Build a good relationship with the
developers&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></u></b></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This is something that I cannot highlight the benefits of enough. It
is something that<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>can benefit<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>a tester in multiple ways. It is something
that will take time and will require a bit of give and take on both sides but the rewards to both developer and tester are well worth it. In my experience having
a good relationship with developers can benefit the tester and project in the
following ways:<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
</div>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Developers willing to spend time
explaining certain system&nbsp;behaviors</i></b>. This helps you as a tester understand
some more in depth detail about certain features and also helps the developer see how a tester may
look at a particular feature if the tester asks some questions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Tester and developer can look at
potential problems together informally.</i></b> Again this helps the tester understand how
a particular feature works and also can enlighten the developer as to how a
tester uses the system by looking at how they encountered the problem. This in turn could lead to the developer writing system tests to cover any scenarios that he/she may of missed to help mitigate risk.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Developer may help Triage client problems.</i></b> Maybe
not an ideal situation but means that problems can get investigated earlier than anticipated. This may due to the tester not being able to triage them for various reasons (Holiday,
Sickness etc..)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><i>Don't have a them and us mentality</i></b>&nbsp;By building
relationships with developers you create a more 'us' mentality than a them and us
mentality. A whole blog post could be written on this but I’m sure you can see
why this is a good thing.</span></li>
</ul>
<b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><u>Use all available resources&nbsp;</u></b><br />
<br />
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Your place of work may be full of
resources such as Books, Users Guides and other items that can help you on
various aspects of the project you are working on. Although these&nbsp;artifacts&nbsp;are&nbsp;useful the most helpful resource you have is..... People. If you are
surrounded by colleagues and need some help, then use them. They are full of
information and at times when you need to know something they will probably be
your best bet for help and support. So if you find yourself having issues
setting up a test environment - ask the support team for help, if you are
having issues understanding a document..... Ask the author. When project
pressures have you wishing for an extra 5 hours in a day remember that any time
consuming problem could potentially be solved a lot quicker by asking someone
for help rather than trying to figure it out all by yourself. Pick your timing
well as disturbing a people at the wrong time may not get you the help you need
and also remember that Doughnuts, Biscuits, Cake and other treats probably help :) Obviously you’re also a potential resource to other people so remember it
works both ways and you never know when you may need someone’s help.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><u>Write&nbsp;Notes up at the end of the day</u></b><o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Being a lone tester in my experience
requires the ability to recall various aspects of testing and project related information
frequently throughout the day. One technique I use to help with this is at the end of the day to email myself any notes I have made during the day. By doing this I have to re-read
my notes as I type out the email which helps to re in-force any important bits and when I come in the next day the first thing I do is read these notes
&nbsp;which jogs my memory as well as enabling me to answer questions quickly about
yesterday’s activities to anyone who may need to know.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><u><br /></u></b></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><u>Testing Focus</u></b></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Focus your testing. Always try and test
the high priority items first as these are the ones that the clients view as
the most important, therefore fixing any problems in these areas should be a
priority and getting sight of them as early in the test cycle as possible is
essential. For example if you have 2 weeks of testing and you &nbsp;spend the 1<sup>st</sup>
week testing that spelling mistakes and field labels are correct any problems
that are found in the second week on the higher priority items developers have
less time to try and fix. Most clients will want the high priority items
working due to there added business benefit and will not worry so much about spelling mistakes and incorrect field labels.</span></div>

<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b><u>Use Session Based Testing</u></b></span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This is something that I have started
using recently and have found it to be useful to focus my testing and me getting
the most out of the time that I have to test a particular feature. For those
who do not know what session based testing is, it is basically breaking testing
down into sessions and using these sessions to explore any charters/areas that
you may want to investigate. I do not use charters (for various reasons) so I
use hourly sessions, and in these I explore a particular feature of the software I am testing. In my
experience to get the best out of this you need to have an undisturbed hour to
really get fully immersed in the feature you are testing. Now this can be
difficult in a busy office. I tend to put some headphones on and listen to music
or just put headphones on with no music playing so you have less chance of being disturbed.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
